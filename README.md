# EnigmaLink

[EnigmaLink] is a web service for secure end-to-end private file sharing.

Documents are encrypted and stored in your own Google Drive and neither 
[Enigma Bridge] nor any prying eyes can see them without links, which are created here and shared by you.

## Description

Once you upload a new document, it is automatically to encrypted onto your own cloud 
drive (Google Drive). The document can then be shared through a secure link to 
friends or colleagues or simply between your own devices.

Your browser will generate a QR code for each document. You can scan that with 
a smartphone or tablet and forward via a different network as an email, text, or tweet â€¦ or print it. 

Documents are encrypted with a state-of-the-art AES hardware encryption and 
stored in your own Google Drive account. Neither Enigma Bridge nor any prying 
eyes can see your documents without the links (or QR codes) that are generated by your own browser.
